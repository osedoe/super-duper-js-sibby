# 1. Constants

There's three ways to define a constant in JS. Write them down below and explain the differences

-var: it can be update and re-declarate in the scope. It scope is global scope.

-let: it can be update but no re-declarate in the scope. It scope is block scope.

-const: it cannot be update nor re-declarate in the scope. And it scope is block scope
