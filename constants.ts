// There's three ways to define a constant in JS. Write them down below and explain the differences

var perrito;                    //It can be update and re-declarate in the scope. 
//Also it has a functional scope.

let perrita;                    //It can be update but no re-declarate in the scope.
//The scope of let variable is block scope.

const cachorro = 'tornillo';    //It cannot be update nor re-decalrate in the scope
                                //The scope of const is block scope.
                                //Also it has to be initializated when it's declarated.
